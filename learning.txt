AUTH:
getServerSession: Usable only on server returns the getServerSession
getSession: usable on client side, check MEMORY for active session, if not available returns null
useSession: client side, for checking inside components.

Next JS User object:
NextAuth.js expects the User object returned from the authorize function to have specific properties that it then uses to populate the session.
By default, NextAuth.js primarily uses the id, name, email, and image properties.
Any additional properties you return (like surname in your case) are not automatically included in the session unless you explicitly handle them in the jwt and session callbacks.

Callbacks needs to be called sequentially
JWT cb user contains the actual authenticated user object returned from authorize fn, set those values to token
Access these available token values in session cb, set these values to new session and return this session
